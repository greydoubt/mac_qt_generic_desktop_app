# mac_qt_generic_desktop_app
as basic as can be

simple MacOS desktop application in C++ that shows a window and has an input box and an output box. The input is accepted after it's typed in by a user, and it's reversed and displayed as the output. There's also a button for processing the input and a list displaying the last 10 strings reversed.

Uses the Qt framework to create the GUI components. The MyWidget class creates the input box, output box, processing button, and list widget. The processInput function is called when the processing button is clicked. It reverses the input string and displays it in the output box. It also adds the original input and the reversed output to the list widget, keeping only the last 10 entries. Finally, the main function creates an instance of the MyWidget class and shows it.

Note that you'll need to install the Qt framework and link against the appropriate libraries to compile and run this code. Also, this is just a simple example, and there are many ways to improve the functionality and usability of this application.
